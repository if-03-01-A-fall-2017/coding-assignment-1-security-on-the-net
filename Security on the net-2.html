      <h2>Common ways of identity theft</h2>
      <section>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Social security identity theft</em></li>
          <p>This one of the most common types of identity theft.</p>
          <p>Once your social security number is stolen, perpetrator can either sell it to undocumented workers or use it to <br />steal property and money, or access opportunities and services available only to social security holders.</p>
          <li><em>Financial identity theft</em></li>
          <p>As the term suggests, financial identity theft occurs when a person’s credit card and bank account information <br />is stolen and used to purchase goods and services.</p><p>Then the fraudster will max out credit cards or even use account information to access new credit <br />cards or financial services.</p>
          <p>This can result in not only a significant loss of money but also prove hazardous to an individual’s future purchasing power<br /> or financial security.</p>
          <p>Financial identity theft can result in a low credit score or can lead to serious debts, the inability to access home ownership, etc.</p>
          <li><em>Driver’s license identity theft</em></li>
          <p>All the thief needs is a person's driving license which is then sold, especially to a person who looks similar to one on the picture on the driving license. <br />But in most cases, criminals use the driving license to hide or protect their own identity if caught in dangerous situations on the road such as DUI or reckless driving. When they then identify themselves based on the information <br />on your ID- card they may successfully be able to avoid going to court or receiving charges as you will be the one the police is looking for.</p>
          <li><em>Criminal identity theft</em></li>
          <p>Criminal identity theft affects numerous individuals. This type occurs when an individual commits a crime <br />under another person’s name. During the process of the criminal act or upon being arrested by law enforcement <br />agents, the criminal will use a fraudulent ID-card with your name and other personal details.</p>
          <li>Medical identity theft</li>
          <p>Medical identity theft occurs when criminals use an individual’s personal information such as medical identification<br /> numbers to access medical products and services.</p>
          <p>This can lead to financial losses as well as future issues arising from incorrect information on a victim’s medical history. If, for instance, your personal information was used to enable a medical procedure or to access to specific prescription drugs, this information may be used by medical professionals in the future to make decisions related to that person's health based on this information. This can lead to wrong treatment, even causing death.

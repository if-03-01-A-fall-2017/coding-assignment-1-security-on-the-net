        <h2>Consequences of ID theft</h2>
        <section>
            <ol>
                <li><em>What impact does identity fraud have?</em></li>
                <p>The consequences of identity fraud will depend on the nature of the crime committed. 
                   If fraudsters gain direct access to your bank account or credit cards, they may leave
                   you with no funds to pay for everyday living costs. In this story on fraud, an individual
                   handed over both his cards and PIN code during a telephone phishing scam and subsequently 
                   struggled to pay for rent or food in the two weeks afterwards.</p>
              
                <li><em>How does identity fraud affect your credit report?</em></li>
                <p>Identity fraud can have a significant effect on your credit history. If a fraudster uses your 
                   existing credit or applies for new credit this could leave a footprint of debt or missed payments 
                   on your credit report. Even if the criminal applies for credit and is rejected this can still 
                   have a negative effect on your credit history as each application for credit is recorded.
                   Although it is possible to correct this information, it can take a while to speak to the relevant
                   parties and demonstrate that you have been the victim of crime. Even a temporary drop in the credit 
                   score lenders use to determine your creditworthiness could be problematic, especially if you are
                   in the middle of opening a new account, buying a car or applying for a mortgage.</p>

                <li><em>Steps to take after identity fraud</em></li>
                <p>If you think you have been a victim of identity theft or notice fraudulent activity in your financial 
                   accounts, there are several steps you should take. Firstly, contact your bank and/or card issuer and 
                   inform them of what has happened, they can then review any unusual activity and cancel or freeze any
                   stolen credit cards or compromised accounts.
                </p>
                <p>You should also report the fraud via the Action Fraud website, they collate cases of fraud from across 
                   the country and their data helps authorities to investigate crimes involving fraud. You can also speak
                   to them online or on the phone if you need advice on how to report fraud and what other organisations 
                   you should contact e.g. if your driving license was stolen you would need to contact the DVLA.
                </p>
                <p>You should also obtain a copy of your credit report if you do not already have one and carefully check
                   the information it contains for any unusual activity. Any incorrect information should be reported to 
                   the agency that provided the report.
                </p>

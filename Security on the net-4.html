            <h3>10 Ways To Protect Yourself From Identity Theft </h3>
            <ol>
                <p>Shielding your private information with no risk of a breakdown may be impossible these days.<br /> 
                   But there are some simple ways to protect you from becoming a victim of Identity Theft.<br />
                   The Police Department is providing these simple, but very important, 
                   tips to protect you and your name.</p>
                <br />
                <li><em>Destroy private records and statements.</em></li>
                <p>Tear up – or, if you prefer, shred – credit cards statements, solicitations, and other documents <br />that contain private financial information.</p>
              
                <li><em>Secure your mail.</em></li>
                <p> Empty you mailbox quickly, lock it or get a P.O. box so criminals don’t have a chance to snatch 
                    credit <br />card pitches. Never mail outgoing bill payments and checks from home. They can be stolen from
                    your <br />mailbox and the payee’s name erased with solvents. Mail them from the post office or another secure location.
                </p>
                <li><em>Safeguard your Social Security number.</em></li>
                <p>Never carry your card with you, or any other card that may have your number, like a health insurance card.<br />
                   Don’t put your number on your checks. It’s the primary target for identity thieves because it gives <br />them 
                   access to your credit report and bank accounts.
                </p>
                <li><em>Don’t leave a paper trail.</em></li>
                <p>
                    Never leave ATM, credit card or gas station receipts behind.
                </p>
                <li><em>Never let your credit card out of your sight.</em></li>
                <p>
                    Worried about credit card skimming? Always keep an eye on your card or, <br />when that’s not possible, pay with cash.
                </p>
                <li><em>Know who you are dealing with. </em></li>
                <p>
                    Whenever anyone contacts you asking for private identity or financial information, make no response other <br />than to 
                    find out who they are, what company they represent and the reason for the call. If you think <br />the request is legitimate, 
                    contact the company yourself and confirm what you were told <br />before revealing any of your personal data.
                </p>
                <li><em>Take your name off marketers hit lists.</em></li>
                <p>
                    In addition to the national Do-Not-Call registry (1-888-382-1222), you can also cut down <br />on junk 
                    mail and opt out of credit card solicitations.
                </p>
                <li><em>Be more defensive with personal information.</em></li>
                <p>
                    Ask salespeople and other if information such as Social Security or driver’s license number is <br />absolutely necessary. 
                    Ask anyone who does require your Social Security number about <br />their privacy policy and that you do not want 
                    your information given to anyone else.
                </p>
                <li><em>Monitor your credit report.</em></li>
                <p>
                    Obtain and thoroughly review your credit report at least once a year to check for suspicious <br />activity. 
                    If you find something, alert your card company or the creditor immediately.<br /> You may also look into credit 
                    protection services, which alerts you any time a <br />change takes place with your credit report.
                </p>
                <li><em> Review your credit cards statements carefully. </em></li>
                <p>
                    Make sure you recognize the merchants, locations and purchases listed before paying the bill. <br />
                    If you don’t need or use department-store or bank-issued credit cards, consider closing the accounts.

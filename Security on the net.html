        <h2>ID Fraud</h2>
        <p>Identity fraud is a crime where one person uses another person's personal data, without <br />authorization, to deceive or defraud that person.</p>
        <p>The fraudster then uses this personal information to, for example, open a credit card<br /> account without permission, and then charge merchandise to that account.</p>
        <p>Identity fraud does not occur when a credit card is simply stolen; that may be consumer fraud, <br />but is not identity fraud.</p>
        <p> Identity fraud is a synonym of unlawful identity change.</p>
        <p>It indicates unlawful activities that use the identity of another person or of a non-existing <br />person fraudulently.</p>
